All of these have good possibilities as animated programs, perhaps with
user interaction:

- Tetris
- Game of Life
- Maze Solver
- Sudoku Solver
- Pong
- Seven-Segment Clock
  - With alarm
- Bomba (Engima Solver)
- Enigma
- Snake
- Minesweeper

- Nintendo-style screen display (grid of sprites, with a few sprites over the top)
  - Probably needs a general-purpose memory
  - How to do iteration over time?

- I2C, serial devices (with buffering)
