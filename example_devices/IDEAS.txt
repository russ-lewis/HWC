All of these have good possibilities as animated programs, perhaps with
user interaction:

- Tetris
- Game of Life
- Maze Solver
- Sudoku Solver
- Pong
- Seven-Segment Clock
  - With alarm
- Bomba (Engima Solver)
- Enigma
- Snake
- Minesweeper

- Nintendo-style screen display (grid of sprites, with a few sprites over the top)
  - Probably needs a general-purpose memory
  - How to do iteration over time?

- I2C, serial devices (with buffering)
  - Or SPI?  Or UART?  Maybe one of each?

- Character display
  - With auto-scroll feature would be cool.  And a good example of heirarchical design!
  - (Also, this display might have an I2C interface?)

- How complex is a VGA adapter?

- Small sound card (perhaps comparable to Nintendo)?
