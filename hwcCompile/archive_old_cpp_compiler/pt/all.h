 * This file is simply a wrapper for other headers.  Include this file
 * if you plan to work on the entire parse tree (such as the parser
 * itself); if you only need to work on certain parts of it, you may
 * include only the smaller bits.
 *
 * (When headers in this directory reference other types (by pointer),
 * they will pre-declare the structs in question, so that we don't have
 * a major recursive-headers problem.)
 *
 * I'm not sure that this design is actually a good idea.  But I'm going
 * to give it a try, to encourage us to be able to work more independently.
