/* Name Scope
 *
 * The names which are available at any given location are organized into a
 * chain of 'scope' objects.  The outermost scope is import scope; in this,
 * each of the imported files shows up a single name.  (Technically, it's
 * represented as a *tree* of objects, since the import names are
 * period-delimited.  But the concept remains.)
 *
 * NOTE: import scope is TBD for the future - for now
 *
 * Below the import scope is the file declaration scope, which lists all of
 * the names declared inside the file, including parts, plugtypes, and any
 * compile-time variables.
 *
 * NOTE: global compile-time variables are TBD for the future - for now
 *
 * Inside each part or plugtype is another scope, which lists all of the
 * fields or plugs declared in that type.
 *
 * Inside if() and for() statemens (but *NOT* static-if()), there is another
 * name scope, which gives the (private) plugs, compile-time variables, and
 * parts which are only visible inside this statement.  These statement
 * scopes can be nested arbitrarily deep (unlike all of the other types).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * As we go through the sematic phase of the compiler, we will build up each
 * of the scopes; we will add names to them as we see new declarations.  As
 * we reach the end of a given block (file, part, plugtype, or statement),
 * we will either save the pointer to this name scope into the object we've
 * created (for later lookup), or else we will free the name scope object.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Searching for a name involves searching through each of the scopes in
 * turn, starting at the deepest one and moving toward the "parent" scopes
 * further out.  A search will either return NULL (name not found), or else
 * a pointer to a nameable object.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Duplicate and overlapping names are never allowed - so, any time that we
 * attempt to add a name to a scope, we will first confirm that the name does
 * not exist in that scope, or any enclosing scope.
 */

/* IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * We are implementing this as a quasi-class.  Implementation is entirely
 * hidden from the caller (and is likely to change when we have time to write
 * better code).  Callers are responsible for using incRef() and decRef() to
 * track how many times a given name scope is referenced; the code will
 * do reference counting and garbage-collect any scope which is no longer in
 * use.  (malloc() implicitly sets a refcount of 1 before it returns the
 * newly-created object.)
