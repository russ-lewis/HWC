 * pointers to the various declarations inside the file; these allow you to
 * find the HWC_Part, HWC_PlugType, etc. pointers.
 *
 * Note that this function does *NOT* create an HWC_File object; that is
 * something which you can create to *contain* this NameScope (when/if that
 * is necessary).
 *

/* ------- HELPER FUNCTIONS FOR THE ABOVE -------
 * All of the rest of the functions below are helpers for the main function
 * above.  That is, main() will call the above, and it will recurse down
 * through the structures of the parse tree, building the various semantic
 * structures.
 *
 * The new structure that we build will (more or less) mirror the parse tree,
 * except that linked lists will be converted into arrays.  Also, decl
 * statements will be inlined into the statement arrays (in the semantic
 * phase, each statement can only contain a single declaration).
 *
 * There are a couple of query functions, which simply return int; these are
 * used to count the number of elements in a list, so that we can allocate
 * arrays.
 *
 * However, most of the logic in this phase is made up of objects that
 * convert parse tree structures into semantic structures.  These functions
 * use three different types of return values, depending on the operation
 * which must be performed: 
 *
 *     - malloc() a struct and return it (like phase10_file() above); return
 *       NULL on error. 
 *
 *     - Take two pointer parameters, an input and output.  The output must
 *       be allocated by the caller (often, as part of an array of such
 *       objects).  Returns 0 on success, nonzero on error. 
 *
 *     - Take an input parameter, which points to the parse tree, and two
 *       output parameters: a pointer to an array variable, and a pointer
 *       to an integer.  Count the size of the parse tree, allocate an
 *       array, fill the array, and store the array pointer and the length
 *       using the output parameters.  Returns 0 on success, nonzero on
 *       error.
 *
 * In addition to the parameters mentioned above, many functions will also
 * take secondary paramters, which are important for the conversion
 * process.

 * *building* the statements, and build smaller arrays to represent the
 * nested statements).
 *
 * The input may be NULL; returns 0 in that case.

 * previously.
 *
 * This function *does* recurse; when converting a BLOCK, IF, or FOR
 * statement, we will completely build all of the nested statements.
 *
 * This function will malloc() an array of semantic statements.  If
 * the input was NULL (meaning no statements), then it will allocate
 * an array with a single STMT_NOP statement.
 *
 * The input is a pointer to the statement list.  It also has two
 * output parameters, where we store the pointer to the allocated
 * array, and its length.
 *
 * The function also includes two name parameters (public and private);
 * the private may be NULL (in the case of statements inside of a plugtype),
 * but the public must never be NULL.
 *
 * This returns 0 on success, nonzero on error.  This function will be
 * responsible for printing out any error message associated with any error;
 * the caller is not expected to print *anything*.

 *
 * DECL: This is weird, because we are inlining the declarations into the

 *       inlined set - this fills in the common fields about the declaration
 *       (type, memory, public, etc.).  Then the _one() call is called on
 *       each name in the list, passing it a pointer to the common struct
 *       (which, in the case of the first decl, is the *same* object).  This
 *       will set up the the per-declaration fields.
