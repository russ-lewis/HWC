/* HWC_Sizes
 *
 * This struct is used to store the sizes of various compnents (and later, the
 * offsets) of various resources; the meaning of each resource is described
 * inside the struct.
 *
 * Most objects (part and plugtype being the only exceptions) have two copies
 * of this struct, one named 'size' and the other named 'offset'.  The 'size'
 * field is the number of these resources consumed by the current object; it is
 * set entirely *independently* of any of the other objects around it.  (Note,
 * however, that the size must include all of the sizes of any objects nested
 * *inside* the current object.  For instance, a STMT_BLOCK will report a size
 * which reflects everything *inside* the block, but which entirely ignores
 * all other statements outside it.
 *
 * The 'offset' field gives the offset to the slot(s) which will be used by
 * this object, to store the resources that it must consume.  This offset is
 * relative to the enclosing object - which is typically a part or plugtype.
 * The offset fields are *always* set, even for objects that don't use any of
 * a particular part type; in that case, the next object will have the same
 * offset for that resource.
 *
 * For example, consider an object tree as follows:
 *    part X
 *        stmt 1 DECL
 *        stmt 2 CONN
 *        stmt 3 IF
 *            stmt 3.1-1 CONN
 *            stmt 3.1-2 CONN
 *          (else)
 *            stmt 3.2-1 CONN
 *        stmt 4 CONN
 *
 * We note that the statements 3.1-1, 3.1-2, and 3.2-1 are all nested inside
 * the IF statement (3).  Thus, the 'size' of 3 would include all of the
 * resources consumed by all 3 of the nested statements *PLUS* any consumed
 * by the IF itself (such as any logical operators used in the loop
 * condition).
 *
 * However, although the statements are nested, we do *NOT* view the nested
 * statements as "inside" the if() for the purposes of the offset calculation.
 * Instead, *all* of these statements give their offsets relative to the
 * *entire* part.  (This allows us to easily generate the wiring diagram.)
 *
 * However, see below for an exception: for() loops!
 *
 * GENERATING THE SIZE AND OFFSET TABLES
 *
 * We fill in both 'size' and 'offset' during phase 30.  We do so recursively.
 * We begin by setting all of the 'offset' fields, of the first object, to
 * zero by calling sizes_set_zero().  In the example above, we would start
 * with the first statement, namely the DECL (1).
 *
 * We then iterate through the objects in the table.  We first calculate the
 * size of the object, and then add the current object's size to its offset
 * to generate the offset of the next.
 *
 * When it is necessary to recurse (such as 3 recursing into 3.1-1), we
 * first calculate the local, non-recursive size, storing it into a temporary
 * variable.  (For an if statement, the non-recursive size reflects the
 * condition, and any logical operators that it requires.)  We then calculate
 * the offset of the first recursive element (in this example, 3.1-1) as the
 * offset of the enclosing element (3) plus the local size.  We then recurse
 * as necessary.  In the case of if(), where we have two different recursive
 * spaces, we arrange them consecutively; the offset of the first 'else'
 * statement follows immediately after the space of the last 'true' statement.
 *
 * Our last step, in a recursive case, is to update the 'size' of the
 * enclosing object, to include both its local and its recursive sizes.
 *
 * USING THE OFFSET TABLES
 *
 * The offset tables are used later on.  When it comes time to actually place
 * various objects into an array (say, placing Connection objects into the
 * wiring diagram), each object uses its own local 'offset' field (plus the
 * "overall position" of the part itself) to determine where to place the
 * elements.
 *
 * So, for instance, if a declaration has offset.bits==13, and the part that
 * it is inside of is at the position bits=129, then this declaration will
 * *actually* be placed at bits=142.
 *
 * FOR LOOPS - THE SPECIAL CASE
 *
 * We've stated above that the 'offset' fields (almost) always use the
 * enclosing part or plugtype as the "base" from which the offset is used.
 * We use this system because each statement, declaration, and expression
 * in a part or plugtype only occurs once per instantiation of the type;
 * however, each type might be instantiated many times.  Thus, in the
 * example above, we had offset.bits==13, with the part at bits=129; thus,
 * the declaration actually starts at bits=142.  But if there was *another*
 * instance of the same part, this time at bits=997, then there would be
 * another instance of the declaration, this time at bits=1010.
 *
 * This system works because (except with for() loops), each statement only
 * appears once per part; thus, part-relative offsets make sense.  However,
 * everything inside a for() loop appears multiple times within the part.
 *
 * Thus, a for() loop functions as a base for offsets - just like a part.
 * That is, the first statement inside a loop will start with offset 0 (for
 * all resources), and the various statements will consume space in much
 * the same way that they do inside a part.
 *
 * What, then, is the size of a for() statement?  It is the size of all of
 * the resources consumed by all passes of the loop: that is, the total
 * size of one pass of the loop, times the number of passes.
 *
 * When we are generating the wiring diagram for a loop, the generator
 * algorithm works basically like this:
 *    part_base = ...
 *    for i=0 to num_passes:
 *        offset_this_pass = part_base + for_loop_offset + i*size_per_pass
 *        build_statements(stmts, offset_this_pass)
 *
 * That is, the offset of the first pass is equal to the base of the part
 * itself, plus the offset of the for statement (since this offset is
 * relative to the part).  On each subsequent pass, the offset increments
 * by the size of one pass.
 *
 * If for() loops are nested, then, for the inner loops, replace "part base"
 * in the above discussion with "starting offset of the enclosing for()
 * loop".
 *
 * OTHER INTERFACE DETAILS
 *
 * When you create an HWC_Sizes object, call sizes_init() to initialize the
 * struct; this will set all of the fields to -1.  (You can call sizes_are_ready()
 * to check, later, to see if a HWC_Sizes struct has had all of its fields
 * set to reasonable values.)
