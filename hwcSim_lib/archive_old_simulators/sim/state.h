	/* how many bits of memory do we need to store?  Note that we store

	 * it is difficult, at the end of a clock cycle, to know in exactly
	 * what order to copy the 'write' bits into the 'read' bits; also,
	 * it's difficult to determine which bits in the system need to be
	 * reset to FLOATING (because they are non-memory) and which should
	 * immediately be valid (because they are the read side of memory).
	 *
	 * So, our simplified end-of-cycle algorithm is:
	 *   - Iterate through all memory regions; check for valid write
	 *     operations; copy any such bits as updates into this state
	 *     array.
	 *   - Wipe *all* bits in the bit space to FLOATING
	 *
	 * Then, at the start of the *next* clock cycle, we do:
	 *   - Copy from the memory space into the appropriate (read-side)
	 *     bits.

	/* this is the current queue of components which are pending
	 * notification.  It is a doubly-linked, circular list, so the node
	 * below is a dummy node.
	 *
	 * When dispatching nodes from this list, we always pull from the head.
	 * In LIFO mode, we also add at the head, and thus this functions as
	 * a stack.  In FIFO mode, we always add at the tail, so it functions
	 * as a queue.
	 *
	 * Note, however, that any "touch" of a node will cause the node to
	 * be moved in the list; since there are two different places where
	 * the node might be (and we're not sure, at any given moment, which
	 * list a node is in), our strategy is always to *remove* a node from
	 * its current position, and place it into its new position.
	 *
	 * DEFERRED NODES
	 *
	 * There are actually *two* lists; a TODO list, and a "deferred" list.
	 * Nodes in the TODO list represent nodes that have recently had one
	 * of their inputs updated, and we haven't yet had time to look at
	 * them; when we finally look at them, we will decide whether or not
	 * it is now possible to write to the output.
	 *
	 * If a component is able to write to its *entire* output, then it
	 * will definitely do so.  However, if it is only able to write to
	 * *part* of the output, (or, if the value that it is writing is
	 * FLOATING), then it will "defer" itself; it makes no changes to the
	 * bits, but will add itself to the (tail of) the deferred list.
	 *
	 * If such a component later has one of its inputs updated, it will
	 * be removed from where it currently is, and placed on the TODO
	 * list; then it will be considered again later.  It might post its
	 * results, or it might be deferred again.
	 *
	 * Nodes may stay on the "deferred" list for a long time; this happens
	 * when they defer themselves once, and then their inputs are not
	 * updated again.  They will not be reconsidered again, until they are
	 * moved back to the TODO list (because their inputs were update) -
	 * or, until the TODO list becomes empty.
	 *
	 * When the TODO list becomes empty, we start dispatching from the
	 * deferred list.  In this mode, components will always write out
	 * *everything* that they are able to write.  Nodes which have written
	 * out partial output might still write again (for instance, maybe the
	 * partial write they performed allows us to determine the value of
	 * some other inputs to the same component - or maybe this component
	 * was only delayed because of *another* deferred component).
	 *
	 * WHY DEFER?
	 *
	 * Think about situations where you have a single connection, which
	 * moves many, many bits all at once, but where the various bits are
	 * calculated by a large number of individual pieces of logic - such
	 * as reading the bits of output from an ALU.
	 *
	 * In such a situation, it may occasionally be useful and necessary
	 * to treat each bit individually - but more often, we want to
	 * "collect" all of the bits before we move the entire output to a
	 * new location.  Thus, while the individual bits are completing
	 * their work, the big copy operation will continually defer itself -
	 * until the *ENTIRE* move can happen, all at once.
	 *
	 * Besides: if the output from the component is moderately large, then
	 * performing a partial write requires a malloc() (to allocate the
	 * bitmask which shows which bits have been written); waiting to
	 * post bits until all of them are ready reduces the number of such
	 * memory allocations which are required.
