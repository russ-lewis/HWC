# TODO: I think it's time to re-factor the debug statements.
#       Instead of (or maybe in addition to?) the per-component debug statements
#       below, we'll have statements which associate subsets of the bit space
#       with snippets from the code.
#
#       Thus, when we have an operation which reads from some particular set of
#       inputs, and which writes to others, then we can mark *all* of the
#       instances of the same 

#debug mappings
#  debug memory read 0 write 1 size 1 "simple_memory.hwc(3:17-3:19) in simple_memory.hwc(13:10-13:2)"   # memory(bit) state
#  debug        start 2        size 1 "simple_memory.hwc(5:13-5:15) in simple_memory.hwc(13:10-13:2)"   # public bit  out
#  debug        start 3        size 1 "simple_memory.hwc(8:11-8:15) in simple_memory.hwc(13:10-13:2)"   #  state inside the NOT operation
#  debug        start 4        size 1 "simple_memory.hwc(8:10-8:15) in simple_memory.hwc(13:10-13:2)"   # !state
